# Microblog-project
Just like with previous projects, please start a basic repository on GitHub with a README.md file and open issues to be assigned to each group member for all of the tasks to be done. Use branches, pull requests, and descriptive commit messages to close each issue once the work is done. Requirements for the app are as follows. A user should be able to: sign up sign in sign out edit their account details delete their account post micro-blogs (posts with less than 150 characters) see a profile page with all of their account details and micro-blog posts to date visit other users' profile pages see a page with the 10 most recent posts (the “feed”) follow other users (wait for help from your instructor) see a list of users they follow
